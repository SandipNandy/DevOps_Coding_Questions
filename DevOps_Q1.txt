Q1. Write a script to automate a server provisioning process using tools like Ansible or Puppet.

==> Assumptions:
             1. You have Ansible installed on a control machine (e.g., your local machine or a separate server).
             2. You have a working SSH connection to the target server(s).
             3. The target server(s) are running a Linux-based OS (e.g.Ubuntu)


Step 1: Install Ansible

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible


Step 2: Define Inventory File (inventory.ini)
An inventory file defines the target servers for your playbook. For example, you might have an inventory file inventory.ini as follows:

[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.31.11

[dbservers]
192.168.13.20


Step 3: Write the Ansible Playbook (provision.yml)
Here's a basic Ansible playbook to automate server provisioning. This script installs packages, configures a firewall, and starts a service:


---
- name: Provision and configure server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

    # Update apt cache
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    # Install necessary packages
    - name: Install packages (nginx, curl, vim)
      apt:
        name:
          - nginx
          - curl
          - vim
        state: present

    # Configure firewall (allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic)
    - name: Allow HTTP and HTTPS through the firewall
      ufw:
        rule: allow
        name: 'Apache Full'
        state: enabled

    # Start and enable Nginx service
    - name: Ensure Nginx is running and enabled
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    # Set up a custom message on the homepage (index.html)
    - name: Create a custom index.html
      copy:
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        content: |
          <html>
            <head><title>Provisioning Successful</title></head>
            <body><h1>Provisioning Successful on {{ inventory_hostname }}</h1></body>
          </html>
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data
        mode: '0644'

    # Ensure the firewall is active
    - name: Enable UFW firewall
      ufw:
        state: enabled



Step 4: Run the Playbook
To run the playbook, use the following command:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini provision.yml
